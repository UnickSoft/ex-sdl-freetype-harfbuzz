This is a simplish sample application to get from zero to rendering unicode
bidirectional text using harfbuzz and fribidi to do the text layout, 
freetype for the underlying font magic, some trivial code for 
the anti-aliased font rasterization, and the SDL 
to create the window to display stuff in.

Based on and forked from https://github.com/lxnt/ex-sdl-freetype-harfbuzz

Many thanks.
